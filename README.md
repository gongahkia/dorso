# `Dorso` ðŸ§ 

Captcha but to catch braindead programmers instead of bots.

*(Credits to [Keith Tang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keibtang/) for the above description.)*

## Rationale

The software development experience in 2025 involves reaching for the closest AI chatbot available, then battling the urge to [punt your laptop across the room](https://media1.tenor.com/m/nJW6x9jzp1AAAAAC/mob-psycho100-mob-psycho.gif) when the chatbot can't understand your poorly worded prompt.

Worried that the convenience and availability of web-based AI chatbots were [making programmers dumber](https://andrewzuo.com/is-ai-making-programmers-stupid-115e9d6e7460), I created `Dorso`.

`Dorso` is a client-sided browser extension that monitors web activity and forces users to correctly answer a random programming question before allowing them access to their [AI chatbot](#details) of choice for the next 15 minutes.
